  example01                 - Example VI.3.4 : Using probabilistic data from a secondary variable
 
  There are 25 hard data randomly located and 400 soft 
  probabilistic data at the nodes of a 20 x 20 grid. The soft 
  pdf are obtained by conditioning with respect to two classes 
  (value<0 or value>0) the variables of interest, using a
  secondary variable correlated with the first one (rho=0.9).
  The objective is to predict at best the values at the nodes
  of the grid. Three approaches are proposed : 
 
  1- kriging with only 25 hard data
  2- kriging with 25 hard data and the conditional soft pdf at
     prediction point taken as "hardened" value
  3- bme with rigorous incorporation of hard data and the
     soft pdf at the estimation point
 
  The first approach is deficient because it does not make use of
  the 400 soft data. For the second approach, because kriging is
  an exact predictor, using as hard data the expectation of the pdf
  does not allow to take into account the hard data at all. Only BME
  is doing a correct job in this case.
